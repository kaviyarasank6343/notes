Mostly used in C# ,VB.Net


 Two types

 2.VB

The requirement for writing the LINQ Query
To write the LINQ Query, we need the following three things:

 *Data Source (in-memory objects, SQL, XML)
 *Query
 *Execution of the Query

Each Query is a combination of three things; they are:
 *Initialization(to work with a particular data source)
 *Condition(where, filter, sorting condition)
 *Selection (single selection, group selection or joining)

syntex
from <variable> in <collection>  
< where, joining, grouping, operators, etc.> <lambda expression>  
<select or groupBy operator> <format the results>  



                                                where 
Filter Data table By using one coloumn 
  DT_Output = (
from row in dt_excel
where row("Name").ToString="mobile"
select row
).CopyToDataTable



                                              Group BY 


 Remove duplicate rows by comparing 2 coloumns 

   DT_output = (
From row In dt_Excel
Group row By a= row("BAN ID").ToString, b= row("Complaint ID").ToString Into grp= Group
Select grp.Last
	).CopyToDataTable
 
 Get Only Duplicate rows 
  
    DT_output = (
From row In dt_Excel
Group row By a= row("BAN ID").ToString, b= row("Complaint ID").ToString Into grp= Group
where grp.Count>1
Select grp.ToList
	).SelectMany(Function(x)x).CopyToDataTable
